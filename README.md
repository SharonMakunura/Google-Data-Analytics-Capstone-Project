# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
Completed in partial fulfillment of Google Data Analytics Certification Course

Took this course in March 2022 and part of it is to complete an analysis project.  This one is from the first track using existing data to answer set questions. 

The repository contains the following files:
cyclistic_analysis_script which contain the analysis in R programming code;
Cyclistic_workbook.twb which contains the Tableau workbook for creating the visuals;
Cyclistic_Presentation_By_S_Makunura which is a read-only PowerPoint file that summarized the findings; and
Excel sumamry files.rar which contains summary files compiled from the analysis process.
